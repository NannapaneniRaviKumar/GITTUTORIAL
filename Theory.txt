command prompt(cmd) in windows : In mac and linux we call cmd as Terminal
Repository is a package/folder for the projects.

READme file -- It is a file that specifies what the project is about.
.GITIGNORE file -- It is a file where we can write the data/files that should be ignored when we add,commit or push the files

The default branch in the GIT is MASTER and in GITHUB is MAIN.

git config --global user.email "my email"
git config --global user.name "my name"       --- to change mail and name of the user

Git & Github
---------------------------
This topic is  divided into mainly 4 parts 
1.VCS & git Repo

VCS means Version Control System Why we call this because consider example , We have a project (website) it got some updates and we re-deployed the updates but at some functionality in the project we got errors/bugs we need to resolve so we need to revert back to the old version and fix those errors, to go to that old version we need to save that project at some place/environment that is VCS. 

We have so many Version Control Systems one them is GIT.

There are several remote repository services like bitbucket,beanstalk,gitlab,github...etc.,

Github is one of the example for the remote repository hosting service.
If we need to work with the project/folder then we should initialise it, to initialize we use

git init -- Initialises the folder as git
git status -- checks the status of the folders 


2.Staging area & commits
3.Branches 
4.Issues & PR's(pull Requests)

Working directory is nothing but the local repository
The folder that we opened in the working directory from the local repository is to make changes, to save that changes we made in working directory to the local repo we use command 

Before committing we send our files to the staging area by using command 

git add . --->This command adds our files to staging area i.e files are ready to be  committed .It is mandate to use add before commit.

after using the add command then we should commit otherwise commit command would not work.

git commit -m "message" --> for multiple files
git commit -m "message" filename --> for a specific file

After committing into local we will push them into the REMOTE REPOSITORY by using command 
git push -u origin master/main

To push intom remote repo from local we need to first connect local to the remote repo by using the path 
specified in the github ex :-

git remote add origin https://github.com/NannapaneniRaviKumar/GITTUTORIAL.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/Account/Project
